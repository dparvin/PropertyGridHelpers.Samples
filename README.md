# PropertyGridHelpers.Samples

This repository contains sample applications and controls that demonstrate how to use the [PropertyGridHelpers](https://github.com/dparvin/PropertyGridHelpers) package.

## Overview

The samples in this repository are designed to:

- Showcase the features and UI editors provided by the PropertyGridHelpers library
- Provide real-world examples for testing and demonstration
- Help developers understand how to use the attributes, editors, and type descriptors in practical scenarios

These samples are intended for **manual testing** and **experimentation**. There are no automated tests or CI build processes for this repository.

## Getting Started

To run the samples:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio.
3. Restore NuGet packages (the main `PropertyGridHelpers` package should be pulled from NuGet).
4. Build and run the sample application.

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or higher
- Windows (due to reliance on Windows Forms)

## Purpose

This project is meant to remain a **developer-focused sandbox** for:
- Testing UI editors like `ModalVisualizer` and `DropDownVisualizer`
- Previewing localization behavior
- Exploring advanced customization in `PropertyGrid`
